    Named Entity Recognition (NER) with SpaCy
        Description: Applying named entity recognition (NER) to identify and classify named entities in text using the SpaCy library. This notebook provides examples and insights into extracting entities like person names, organizations, and locations from text.
        Notebook: NER_with_SpaCy.ipynb

    Sentiment Analysis with LSTM
        Description: Building a sentiment analysis model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This project demonstrates how to preprocess text data, train an LSTM model, and evaluate its performance on sentiment analysis tasks.
        Notebook: Sentiment_Analysis_LSTM.ipynb

    Topic Modeling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
        Description: Utilizing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to discover hidden topics within a collection of text documents. This notebook walks you through the process of applying LDA to a dataset and visualizing the resulting topics.
        Notebook: Topic_Modeling_LDA.ipynb

    Machine Translation using Transformer Models
        Description: Implementing a machine translation system using Transformer models, such as BERT or GPT-2. This project showcases the power of transformer-based models in the domain of language translation.

    Notebook: Machine_Translation_Transformer.ipynb

    Text Generation with GPT-2
        Description: Generating text using the powerful GPT-2 language model. This notebook demonstrates how to fine-tune GPT-2 on a specific dataset and generate creative and coherent text based on the learned patterns.
        Notebook: Text_Generation_GPT2.ipynb

    Document Summarization with BART
        Description: Implementing document summarization using BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers). This project shows how to fine-tune BART for summarizing longer pieces of text, such as articles or documents.
        Notebook: Document_Summarization_BART.ipynb

    Sentiment Analysis using Transformers and Transfer Learning
        Description: Building a sentiment analysis model using transformer-based architectures (such as BERT) and transfer learning techniques. This notebook demonstrates how to leverage pre-trained transformer models for sentiment analysis tasks.
        Notebook: Sentiment_Analysis_Transfer_Learning.ipynb
